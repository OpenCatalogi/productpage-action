# Productpage action
This action builds on repository specific product page as static github page.

## Usage
To use this action, simply include it as a step in your workflow file. No inputs are required.

````yaml
name: My Product Page Workflow

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Product Github Page
        uses: OpenCatalogi/productpage-action@main
````

In the above example an page is created or updated every night at 0:00, we advise this route becouse you will autmaticly suplied with fixes and new features. You can however also choose other options to trigger a page build

To trigger a page build whenever you commit something to the main  branche
````yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
````

To gain a bit more control and only trigger a page build manually usw
````yaml
on:
  
  workflow_dispatch:
````
> **Warning**
> If you do not supply the action with an access token or an SSH key, you must access your repositories settings and provide `Read and Write Permissions` to the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`, otherwise you'll potentially run into permission issues. Alternatively you can set the following in your workflow file to grant the action the permissions it needs.

```yml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

> **Note**
> When you first run the workflow you need to `manually` activate github pages on your repository! Head over to setting -> pages. Select `deploy form a branch` as a source and `gh-pages` as your branche (unles you configured the page to be build in a differend branche)
